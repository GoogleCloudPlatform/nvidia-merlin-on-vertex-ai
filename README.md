# NVIDIA Merlin on Vertex AI

This repository compiles prescriptive guidance and code samples for operationalization of [NVIDIA Merlin framework](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-merlin) on [Google Cloud Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai).

[NVIDIA Merlin](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-merlin) is an open-source framework for building large-scale deep learning recommender system. [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) is Google Cloud's unified Machine Learning platform to help data scientists and machine learning engineers increase experimentation, deploy faster, and manage models with confidence. Using NVIDIA Merlin with Vertex AI enables developers to build, train and deploy custom end-to-end recommender systems at scale, within Vertex AIâ€™s unified and fully-managed  MLOps platform.

The content in this repository centers around five core scenarios:

- Setting up Merlin experimentation and development environment in [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench). 
- Operationalizing large scale data preprocessing pipelines with [NVIDIA Merlin NVTabular](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-merlin/nvtabular) and [Vertex AI Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/introduction).
- Training large-scale deep learning ranking models with [NVIDIA Merlin HugeCTR](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-merlin/hugectr) and [Vertex AI Training](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/custom-training).
- Deploying models and serving predictions with [NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server) and [Vertex AI Prediction](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/getting-predictions)
- Implementing end to end data preprocessing, training, and deployment pipelines with [Vertex AI Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/introduction).

For detailed information about NVIDIA Merlin components and Vertex AI services, refer to [NVIDIA Merlin](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-merlin) and [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) documentation. 

The dataset used by all samples in this repo is [Criteo 1TB Click Logs dataset](https://ailab.criteo.com/download-criteo-1tb-click-logs-dataset/) provided by [The Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com/about-us/). 



## Architecture Overview

The below figure summarizes a high level architecture of the solution demonstrated in this repo.

### Large scale data preprocessing

Commercial recommenders are trained on huge datasets, often several hundreds of terabytes in size. At this scale, data preprocessing steps often take much more time than training recommender machine learning models. [NVTabular](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-merlin/nvtabular) - a core component of *Merlin* - is a feature engineering and preprocessing library designed to effectively manipulate terabytes of recommender system datasets and significantly reduce data preparation time. 

In this repo we demonstrate how to operationalize NVTabular data preprocessing workflows using Vertex AI Pipelines and multi-GPU processing nodes. The repo includes two samples of reusable and customizable data preprocessing pipelines developed using [Kubeflow Pipelines SDK](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/sdk-overview/) and [Google Cloud pipeline components](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/build-pipeline#google-cloud-components). 

The first pipeline demonstrates how to process large CSV datasets managed in [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage). The second pipeline digests source data from [Google BigQuery](https://www.google.com/search?q=bigquery&oq=bigquery&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l9.1610j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

### Training large-scale deep learning recommender models

[Merlin HugeCTR](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/HugeCTR) is NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated, highly scalable recommender framework. NVIDIA HugeCTR facilitates  implementations of leading deep learning recommender models such as [Google's Wide and Deep](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792) and, [Facebook's DLRM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04247).

The repo includes an example of how to operationalize training and hyperparameter of the HugeCTR implementation of the [DeepFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04247) model using [Vertex AI Training](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/custom-training) and massively scalable [A2 Virtual Machines](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/a2-vms-with-nvidia-a100-gpus-are-ga), powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

### Deploying and serving deep learning ranking inference pipelines 

[NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server) is an open-source inference serving software that can deploy and serve trained AI models from any framework on both CPUs and GPUs. Triton supports ensemble models that can be used to implement multi-step inference pipelines. 

The repo includes a sample that demonstrates how to create, deploy, and serve a Triton ensemble model using Vertex AI Prediction. The example ensemble implements an inference pipeline that integrates NVTabular data preprocessing workflow with a HugeCTR deep learning model. 

### End to end MLOps workflow

Design patterns and best practices outlined in the previous sections come together in the last component of the solution - a reference implementation of the machine learning pipeline that integrates data preprocessing, training, and deployment into a unified end to end workflow.

### Experimentation and development environment

A flexible and powerful experimentation and development environment is critical in recommender system projects. In the environment setup section of this repo we outline steps to configure the environment depicted on the below figure. 

![NVIDIA Merlin dev](images/dev-env.png)

The environment is based on [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/introduction). Container images based on NVIDIA NGC [Merlin training](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/merlin/containers/merlin-training) and [Merlin inference](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/merlin/containers/merlin-inference) images are installed as managed notebooks kernels augmenting the standard features of a managed notebook instance that include UI and programmatic interfaces to Google Cloud services.


## Repository structure

The core content of the repository comprises of a series of Jupyter notebooks and a set of Python modules. The notebooks compile detailed guidance on implementing the  solution's components described at a high level in the previous section. The Python modules encapsulate reusable code components that are used in the notebooks and in Vertex AI jobs and pipelines. 

Currently, the repo includes the following notebooks:

1. [00-dataset-management](00-dataset-management.ipynb) - describes and explores the Criteo dataset, and loads it to BigQuery.
2. [01-dataset-preprocessing](01-dataset-preprocessing.ipynb) - guidance for large-scale data preprocessing with NVTabular and Vertex Pipelines
3. [02-model-training-hugectr](02-model-training-hugectr.ipynb) - guidance for training HugeCTR models with Vertex Training.
